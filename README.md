## About the Project

The user first enters the number of rounds to be played.  
For each round, the user selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors.  
The computer makes its choice randomly.  
Based on the rules of the game, the winner of each round is decided and the score is updated.  
After all rounds are completed, the final result of the game is displayed.

This project is mainly created to understand basic Python programming, GUI development using Tkinter, and event handling.
